# Dog_Breed_Classifier
## ResNet50 Image classification Model
Its a competition problem from kaggle but with lesser number of labels to predict from. I used transfer learning in this model and used ResNet50 architecture, with  image size [312, 312], also used Tensorflow high level API tf.data for faster computation.

In this project I only trained the model for 10 specific breeds of dog.
